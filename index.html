            Abstract:
        </h2>
        <p> With an estimate 3.5 billion users of smart phones (techjury), the risk of malware <br>
            infecting a phone and its user is higher than ever, and of total smart phone users <br>
            over 2.8 billion of them are users of Android smartphones (BusinessofApps).<br>
            Due to the sheer size of users and the amount of malware they are susceptible to,<br>
            we wanted to create a way for users to be able to recognize between a harmless <br>
            application and a malicious one. As applications can only function based on the <br>
            permissions they are given, we focused on how we can different malware from <br>
            benign applications based on the permissions the application asks for. As a lot <br>
            malicious applications function similarly to one another, they also have similar<br>
            permissions they ask the user for. We want users to have a way of quickly and easily<br>
            finding out whether an application they want to download is malware or not. We <br>
            will do this by creating a trained machine learning model that will test against<br>
            different applications and compare permissions of benign and malicious applications.<br>
            With this testing our model will be able to differentiate between benign and<br>
            malicious applications on an application store before the end user is ever required<br> to download the application.
