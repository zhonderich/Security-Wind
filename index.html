            <h2>
                Abstract:
            </h2>
            <p> With an estimate 3.5 billion users of smart phones (techjury), the risk of malware 
                infecting a phone and its user is higher than ever, and of the total smart phone users 
                over 2.8 billion of them use an Android smartphones (BusinessofApps).
                Due to the sheer size of users and the amount of malware they are susceptible to,
                we wanted to create a way for users to be able to recognize between a harmless 
                application and a malicious one. As applications can only function based on the 
                permissions they are given, we focused on how we can different malware from 
                benign applications based on the permissions the application asks for. As a lot 
                malicious applications function similarly to one another, they also have similar
                permissions they ask the user for. We want users to have a way of quickly and easily
                finding out whether an application they want to download is malware or not. We
                will do this by creating a trained machine learning model that will test against
                different applications and compare permissions of benign and malicious applications.
                With this testing our model will be able to differentiate between benign and
                malicious applications on an application store before the end user is ever required
                to download the application.

            <p> This project is considered work in progress and as such will be subject to changes
                over time. Currently a date for the publicly available release has not been set,
                however I am more then happy to conduct a live demo which can be scheduled by emailing
                zhonderich@gmail.com. The draft .pdf file linked in the left hand navigation
                bar is a rough draft of the research paper and will be updated to the finished copy
                at the end of the Winter 2022 term upon successful submission to Seneca Libraries.<br><br>
                Thank you for your interest in Security Wind!
